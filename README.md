# Travel Destination Selection Website

This project is a website designed to streamline the process of selecting a travel destination and purchasing flight tickets. It utilizes state machines with XState to create a step-by-step guide through the flight purchasing process. Each step of the purchase is represented by a different state, guiding the user from the beginning to the end of the flow and looping back to the beginning.

## Technologies Used
 React: Used as the primary JavaScript library for building the user interface.
 Vite: Used as the build tool to set up a fast development environment.
 XState: Utilized to manage state machines, controlling the flow of the purchase process.
